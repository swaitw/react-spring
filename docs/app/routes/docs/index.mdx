# Overview

Welcome to the `react-spring` docs site!

import { NAV_TILES } from '~/data/fixtures'
import { NavigationGrid } from '~/components/Grids/NavigationGrid'

<NavigationGrid cols={2} tiles={NAV_TILES} />

## What is this?

Our old documentation was lacking in features & clarity. So, based on
community feedback, we've made an endeavor to improve our documentation with a
few key differences:

- We want to explain more of our codebase conceptually e.g what is an `animated`
  component
- All our content will be searchable so no more running around in the dark
- Step-by-step tutorials on how to achieve common use-cases

## How can I help?

Thank you for being interested in helping! It means a lot, if you want to provide
generic feedback please do so [here](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring/discussions/1931).
Otherwise, each page has it's own feedback button you can use to give an up or down
vote, followed by the option to then add written feedback.

If you're interested in adding an example to the site then why not check out the specific
[contributing guide](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring/tree/master/demo/CONTRIBUTING.md).
